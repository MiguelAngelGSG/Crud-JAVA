APP DESCRIPTION

To promote the proper management of time and efficiency a tasks organizer has been created in Java. This App allows users to manage their daily tasks in a simple and easy way. Using the terminal, this App allows the user 5 different initial inputs:

Add a new task
Eliminate an existing task
Check the tasks list
Mark a task as completed
Exit
Using text based inputs you can create a tasks list, keep track of the ones that are yet to be done or have been finished and elimiate irrelevant tasks or mistakes.

WORK PROGRESSION

First of all we created a GitHub repository and experimented on it to make sure we understood how it works and broke as much as we could before working on the project. After setting the main branch, we created a dev branch to work on the project. We searched on the internet examples of such excercise to use as a blueprint to make our own code. After trying our project and making sure it works, a push was made into the dev branch and then merged into the main.
